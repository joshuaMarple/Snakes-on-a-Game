Thanks for making a donation!

These assets were created to aid programmers and for me to meet new people.
In order to keep making these assets I have to start accepting donations, since these take up a huge chunk of my free time.

Thanks to people like you the community will keep receiving assets like these, not only from me, but everyone taking their time to contribute.
